# Scrabble Project
*@authors: Bernard Debecker and Romain Foncier*

#### MAVEN CONFIGURATION ####

From now the projects are managed by [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html) a very great *Project Management Tools* which allows to directly load dependencies, compile & build, launch the unittest, ...

All new modules, packages or plugins must be added in the `POM.xml` in each project folder. If you search a module, looking [here](http://search.maven.org/)

To add this module, just issue the following lines in the POM.xml file :

	// Example with Jackson :
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.codehaus.jackson</groupId>
		<artifactId>jackson-mapper-asl</artifactId>
		<version>1.8.5</version>
	</dependency>
